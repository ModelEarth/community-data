# Community Datasets

View our [Active Projects](/projects/).

Our work combines four primary datasets:

- [Annual NAICS Industry Levels](https://github.com/ModelEarth/community-data/tree/master/industries/naics/US) for counties and zip codes for [ML training and timelines](https://github.com/ModelEarth/community-timelines/).
- [Input-Output Impacts for Industries](/community/tools/) across [24 EEIO indicators](/localsite/info/).
- [Open Footprint](/OpenFootprint) - [US EPA Footprints + Exiobase](/useeio.js/footprint) and [BuildingTransparency.org](https://BuildingTransparency.org)
- [All The Places](/places/) - Locations [sorted](https://github.com/modelearth/places-data/) by country, state and zip
