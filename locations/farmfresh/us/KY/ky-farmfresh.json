It is one of few markets in downtown Louisville and is dedicated to increasing availability of fresh foods to an underserved area. The market offers customers a great variety of local vendors and products. We are open the first Thursday of each month from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. from June through October.\r\n\r\nHISTORY: In 2009, the University of Louisville School of Public Health and Information Sciences (SPHIS) led efforts to establish the Gray Street Farmers Market (GSFM) in partnership with the Louisville Metro Dept. of Public Health and Wellness (LMPHW). The GSFM operated weekly (rain or shine) from mid-May through the end of October for 11 seasons. We did not open in 2019 or 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic and resource limitations . \r\n","ContactName":"Melissa
