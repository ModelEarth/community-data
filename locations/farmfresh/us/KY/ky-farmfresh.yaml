  Description: "The GSFM is unique collaboration between local organizations with\
    \ a shared goal of creating conditions under which people can be healthy. It is\
    \ one of few markets in downtown Louisville and is dedicated to increasing availability\
    \ of fresh foods to an underserved area. The market offers customers a great variety\
    \ of local vendors and products. We are open the first Thursday of each month\
    \ from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. from June through October.\r\n\r\nHISTORY: In 2009, the\
    \ University of Louisville School of Public Health and Information Sciences (SPHIS)\
    \ led efforts to establish the Gray Street Farmers Market (GSFM) in partnership\
    \ with the Louisville Metro Dept. of Public Health and Wellness (LMPHW). The GSFM\
    \ operated weekly (rain or shine) from mid-May through the end of October for\
    \ 11 seasons. We did not open in 2019 or 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic and resource\
    \ limitations . \r\n"
