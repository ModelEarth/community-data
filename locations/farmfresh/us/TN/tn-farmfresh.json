Tennessee; and in the Central Appalachian region. Most products are sold direct-to-consumer to maximize the revenue returned to the vendor. Products include fruits, vegetables, grains, honey, pizza, coffee, meats, and pot pies.","1":"Jonesborough Farmers Market is a 100% producer-only market - which means that all products brought to the market are grown, raised, or made by the vendor. We also limit vendors to a 10-mile radius of Jonesborough, TN, which guarantees the freshest locally-grown products are available. We offer live music, a walking program, and a kids activity once per month. We accept SNAP-EBT funds and participate in a SNAP-match program.","2":"The Winter Market picks up where the Jonesborough Farmers Market leaves off. We open vendor sign-ups to all active JFM vendors and move locations to in front of Boone Street Market. This year, we'll operate on the first three Saturdays in November and December, and the third Saturday January through April, from 9 am to 12 pm. All products are grown, raised, or made locally - by the vendor.","3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":"Come find the freshest locally grown produce & support West Tennessee farmers at the Martin Farmers Market conveniently located in downtown.
