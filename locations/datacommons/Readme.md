# Data Commons Data Prep

This folder stores the historic data of all available years for Population and Emissions on us-counties, us-states and countries level in csv format.

[StateFilter Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1riRnKUGNGkJZOU6qJoznAxjySInQjnFQ?usp=sharing):  
The code to extract the data using Google Data Commons API in python can be found in this colab.
The data is manually uploaded to github for now.

TO DO: Add the code to push the files from Colab directly to the github.
